# Advanced Water Tracker

A computer vision-based water consumption tracking system that monitors drinking habits in real-time using pose detection and motion analysis algorithms.

## Overview

The Advanced Water Tracker utilizes computer vision techniques to monitor hydration through pose detection algorithms. The system tracks wrist movements to identify drinking motions, providing accurate real-time measurement of water consumption through standard webcam input without requiring specialized hardware.

## Core Features

The system incorporates real-time pose detection for continuous monitoring of user behavior. An intelligent calibration system adapts to individual drinking patterns, ensuring optimal detection accuracy. The application provides accurate volume tracking by converting detected sip events into milliliter measurements and automatically persists drinking events with timestamps for analysis.

Visual feedback mechanisms provide immediate status information, while configurable parameters allow customization of sensitivity settings. Comprehensive session analytics deliver detailed summaries of daily water intake patterns.

## Technical Architecture

The water tracking system operates through a three-phase process combining computer vision, signal processing, and behavioral analysis.

Pose detection utilizes Google's MediaPipe library to identify human pose landmarks, specifically monitoring wrist positions for both hands while processing video feeds at over 30 frames per second.

Motion analysis algorithms track vertical wrist movements to identify drinking motions. Smoothing algorithms reduce noise while dead zone filtering ignores minor hand tremors that could generate false detections.

The sip detection logic implements a compound framework where events are registered when wrist position exceeds calibrated thresholds while detecting significant upward motion. Temporal filtering enforces minimum delays between consecutive detections to prevent double-counting.

## Installation and Configuration

The application requires Python 3.7 or higher with OpenCV 4.5.0+, MediaPipe 0.8.0+, and NumPy 1.21.0+. Clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and install dependencies using the provided requirements file.

For initial setup, launch the application to initialize the webcam feed, execute calibration by performing drinking motions over ten seconds, then activate tracking mode to begin monitoring.

## Operation

Control commands include calibration initiation, tracking toggle, data reset, help display, and application termination. The visual interface displays real-time status information with operational mode indicators, volume displays in milliliters and liters, and running sip count totals.

## Technical Specifications

The system operates with configurable parameters including fifteen milliliters per detected sip, ten-frame smoothing windows, 0.01-unit dead zone thresholds, one-second minimum sip intervals, and 0.5 confidence thresholds for pose detection.

Data output generates structured JSON records containing timestamps, cumulative volume measurements, and sequential sip counts. Session summaries provide aggregate statistics including total counts, cumulative volume, and consumption rates.

## System Architecture

The modular architecture includes WaterTrackerApp as the primary controller, WristTracker for pose detection and motion analysis, CalibrationManager for threshold optimization, and WaterConsumptionTracker for sip counting and data persistence.

Data processing follows a linear pipeline from camera input through MediaPipe processing, wrist tracking, motion analysis, sip detection, volume calculation, and data storage.

## Configuration

Volume estimation and detection sensitivity can be customized through parameter modification. Calibration duration, smoothing windows, and dead zone thresholds are adjustable for different use cases and environments.

## Applications

The system supports personal health monitoring, workplace wellness programs, medical fluid intake tracking, elderly care hydration monitoring, and research applications including behavioral studies and computer vision algorithm development.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues include insufficient detection due to poor calibration or lighting, excessive false positives requiring parameter adjustment, camera access problems, and performance optimization through resolution or threshold adjustments.

## Future Development

Planned enhancements include multi-user support, bottle size detection, mobile integration, machine learning improvements, cloud synchronization, and advanced analytics. Technical improvements will focus on GPU acceleration, background subtraction, and three-dimensional pose estimation.

## Conclusion

The Advanced Water Tracker provides accurate, non-invasive hydration monitoring through computer vision techniques, suitable for personal, institutional, and research applications while maintaining ease of use across diverse user populations.
